 * Data loaded from a {@link RasterResource} and potentially shown as {@link RenderedImage}.
 * The rendered image is usually mono-banded, but may be multi-banded in some special cases
 * handled by {@link RasterResource#read(GridGeometry, int...)}.
 *
 * <p>The inherited {@link #data} buffer contains the sample values, potentially multi-banded. If there is more than
 * one band to put in the rendered image, then each band is a {@linkplain DataBuffer#getNumBanks() separated bank}
 * in the buffer, even if two banks are actually wrapping the same arrays with different offsets.
 * The latter case is better represented by {@link java.awt.image.PixelInterleavedSampleModel},
 * but it is {@link ImageRenderer} responsibility to perform this substitution as an optimization.</p>
