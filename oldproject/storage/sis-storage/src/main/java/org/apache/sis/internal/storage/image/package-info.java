/**
 * Bridges between Apache SIS data stores and Java Image I/O.
 * This package provides {@link org.apache.sis.storage.DataStore} implementations wrapping
 * {@link javax.imageio.ImageReader} and {@link javax.imageio.ImageWriter} instances.
 * The data stores delegate the reading and writing of pixel values to the wrapped reader or writer,
 * completed with an additional source of information for georeferencing the image.
 * A commonly-used convention is the <cite>World File</cite> format.
 *
 * <h2>Limitations</h2>
 * The World File reader and writer currently have the following limitations.
 * Those limitations may be addressed in a future SIS version.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Image metadata are ignored. Some metadata that a future version could use are:
 *       title, author, description, creation time, <i>etc.</i></li>
 *   <li>Deferred reading of tiles (using {@code ImageReader.readTileRaster(â€¦)})
 *       is not yet implemented.</li>
 *   <li>Resources have no identifier if the data store is writable,
 *       because image indices are no longer stable identifiers in such case.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>TODO:</b> avoid extending internal classes directly,
 * then move in a public package with {@code imageio} package name.</p>
