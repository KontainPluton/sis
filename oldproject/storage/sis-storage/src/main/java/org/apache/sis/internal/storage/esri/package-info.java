/**
 * Simple data store implementations for some ESRI grid formats (ASCII and binary).
 * The data formats supported by this package are relatively simple.
 * Values are stored either in plain ASCII text or in RAW binary encoding (without compression).
 *
 * <h2>Extensions</h2>
 * The implementation in this package adds the following extensions
 * (some of them are taken from GDAL):
 *
 * <ul class="verbose">
 *   <li>Coordinate reference system specified by auxiliary {@code *.prj} file.
 *       If the format is WKT 1, the GDAL variant is used (that variant differs from
 *       the OGC 01-009 standard in their interpretation of units of measurement).</li>
 *   <li>ASCII Grid reader accepts also some metadata defined for the binary formats
 *       ({@code XDIM}, {@code YDIM}, color file, statistics file, <i>etc.</i>).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Limitations</h2>
 * Statistics file ({@code *.stx}) contains {@code band}, {@code minimum}, {@code maximum}, {@code mean},
 * {@code std_deviation}, {@code linear_stretch_min} and {@code linear_stretch_max} values.
 * But in current Apache SIS implementation, the last two values ({@code linear_stretch_*}) are ignored.
 *
 * <p>Color map file ({@code *.clr}) is read only when the raster does not have 3 or 4 bands
 * (in which case the raster is considered RGB) and when the data type is byte or unsigned short.
 * In all other cases, notably in the case of floating point values, the color map is ignored.</p>
 *
 * <p>Current implementation of ASCII Grid store loads, caches and returns the full image
 * no matter the subregion or subsampling specified to the {@code read(â€¦)} method.
 * Sub-setting parameters are ignored.</p>
