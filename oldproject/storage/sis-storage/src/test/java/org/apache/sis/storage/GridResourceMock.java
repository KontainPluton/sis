 * A resource for one-banded images generated on-the-fly when {@link #read(GridGeometry, int...)} is invoked.
 * This class has some similarities with {@link org.apache.sis.internal.storage.MemoryGridResource} except that
 * the {@link GridCoverage} returned by {@link #read read(â€¦)} is guaranteed to wrap an image having exactly the
 * requested size (i.e. the size specified by {@link GridGeometry#getExtent()}).
 * By contrast {@code org.apache.sis.internal.storage.MemoryGridResource} may return images larger than requested,
 * which make testing more difficult.
