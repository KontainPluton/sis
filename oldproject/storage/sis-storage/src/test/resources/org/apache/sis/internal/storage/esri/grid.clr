Color map for `grid.asc` file. This auxiliary file is
actually is actually for BIP/BIL/BSQ raster formats,
but Apache SIS applies it to ASCII Grid file as well.

-10   0   0 255   (blue)
  0   0 255 255   (cyan)
 10   0 255   0   (green)

 30 255 165   0   (orange)

Note: in current Apache SIS implementation this file is ignored
because ASCII grid data are floating points and color maps are
restricted to integer types.
