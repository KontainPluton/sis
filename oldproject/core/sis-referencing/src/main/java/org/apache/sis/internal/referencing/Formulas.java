     * However for values close to 1, this approximation seems to stay within 1 ULP of {@code Math.hypot(…)}.
     * We tested with random values in ranges up to [-6 … +6].
     *
     * <p>We define this method because {@link Math#hypot(double, double)} has been measured with JMH as 6 times
     * slower than {@link Math#sqrt(double)} on Java 14.  According posts on internet, the same performance cost
     * is observed in C/C++ too. Despite its cost, {@code hypot(…)} is generally recommended because computing a
     * hypotenuse from large magnitudes has accuracy problems. But in the context of {@code NormalizedProjection}
     * where semi-axis lengths are close to 1, input values should be (x,y) coordinates in the [−1 … +1] range.
     * The actual range may be greater (e.g. [−5 … +5]), but it still far from ranges requiring protection against
     * overflow.</p>

     * <h4>Caution</h4>
     * We may not need the full {@code Math.hypot(x,y)} accuracy in the context of map projections on ellipsoids.
     * However some projection formulas require that {@code fastHypot(x,y) ≥ max(|x|,|y|)}, otherwise normalizations
     * such as {@code x/hypot(x,y)} could result in values larger than 1, which in turn result in {@link Double#NaN}
     * when given to {@link Math#asin(double)}. The assumption on x, y and {@code sqrt(x²+y²)} relative magnitude is
     * broken when x=0 and |y| ≤ 1.4914711209038602E-154 or conversely. This method does not check for such cases;
     * it is caller responsibility to add this check is necessary, for example as below:
     *
     * {@preformat java
     *     double D = max(fastHypot(x, y), max(abs(x), abs(y)));
     * }
     *
     * According JMH, above check is 1.65 time slower than {@code fastHypot} without checks.
     * We define this {@code fastHypot(…)} method for tracing where {@code sqrt(x² + y²)} is used,
     * so we can verify if it is used in context where the inaccuracy is acceptable.
     *
     * <h4>When to use</h4>
     * We reserve this method to ellipsoidal formulas where approximations are used anyway. Implementations using
     * exact formulas, such as spherical formulas, should use {@link Math#hypot(double, double)} for its accuracy.
     *
     * @param  x    one side of the triangle. Should be approximately in the [-1 … +1] range.
     * @param  y  other side of the triangle. Should be approximately in the [-1 … +1] range.
     * @return hypotenuse, not smaller than {@code max(|x|,|y|)} unless the values are less than 1.5E-154.
