/**
 * Placeholder for a RTree. This simple implementation is not designed for scalability or performance.
 * This class is there for minimal service, to be replaced in some future Apache SIS version by a more
 * sophisticated tree. Current version of this class is okay for small trees where big nodes are added
 * before small nodes.
 *
 * <p>A {@code RTreeNode} instance is used as the root of the tree. Children nodes are stored as a linked list
 * (the list is implemented by the {@link #sibling} field, which reference the next element in the list).</p>
 *
 * <div class="note"><b>Possible evolution:</b>
 * a future version could avoid extending {@link GeneralEnvelope}. Instead we could provide abstract
 * {@code contains(â€¦)} methods and let subclasses define them, with possibly more efficient implementations.
 * We would still need an implementation that delegate to {@link GeneralEnvelope} since that class has the
 * advantage of handling envelopes crossing the anti-meridian.</div>
