/**
 * Selects an object in a sequence of objects using their extent as a criterion.
 * The selection is based on the temporal extent and geographic area using the following rules:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Object having largest intersection with the time of interest (TOI) is selected.</li>
 *   <li>If two or more candidates have the same intersection with TOI,
 *       then the one with less "overtime" (time outside TOI) is selected.</li>
 *   <li>If two or more candidates are considered equal after above criteria,
 *       then the one best centered on the TOI is selected.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <div class="note"><b>Rational:</b>
 * the "smallest time outside" criterion (rule 2) is before "best centered" criterion (rule 3)
 * because of the following scenario: if a user specifies a "time of interest" (TOI) of 1 day
 * and if the candidates are a raster of monthly averages and a raster of daily data, we want
 * the daily data to be selected even if by coincidence the monthly averages is more centered.</div>
 *
 * If there is no time of interest, or the candidate objects do not declare time range,
 * or some objects are still at equality after application of above criteria,
 * then the selection continues on the basis of geographic criteria:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Largest intersection with the {@linkplain #areaOfInterest area of interest} (AOI) is selected.</li>
 *   <li>If two or more candidates have the same intersection area with AOI, then the one with the less
 *       "irrelevant" material is selected. "Irrelevant" material are area outside the AOI.</li>
 *   <li>If two or more candidates are considered equal after above criteria,
 *       the one best centered on the AOI is selected.</li>
 *   <li>If two or more candidates are considered equal after above criteria,
 *       then the first of those candidates is selected.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Change of rule order</h2>
 * The following configuration flags change the order in which above rules are applied.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #alternateOrdering} — whether the time center criterion is tested last.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * Example:
 *
 * {@preformat java
 *     ExtentSelector<Foo> selector = new ExtentSelector<>(areaOfInterest);
 *     for (Foo candidate : candidates) {
 *         selector.evaluate(candidate.extent, candidate),
 *     }
 *     Foo best = selector.best();
