/**
 * A node in a {@link PointTree} which is the parent of other nodes. The number of child nodes depends
 * on the number of dimensions of the tree: 4 children with two-dimensional <cite>QuadTree</cite>,
 * 8 children with three-dimensional <cite>Octree</cite>, <i>etc</i>.
 * The child node can be another {@link PointTreeNode} if that node is itself the parent of more nodes.
 * Otherwise (i.e. if the child node is leaf) the child is an instance of {@code Object[]}.
 *
 * <p>Features of arbitrary types are stored in {@code Object[]} arrays. Those arrays should be small:
 * if the number of elements in a leaf exceeds a maximal capacity specified by the {@link PointTree},
 * then the leaf is replaced by a new {@link PointTreeNode} and the {@code Object[]} content
 * is distributed between the new child nodes.</p>
 *
 * <p>Addition of new features in {@code Object[]} arrays uses a <cite>copy-on-write</cite> strategy
 * in order to keep memory usage minimal (a tree may have thousands of small arrays) and for making
 * easier to ensure thread-safety during concurrent read/write operations.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Design note</h2>
 * Trees may have huge amount of nodes. For that reason, the nodes should contain as few fields as possible.
 * We should also avoid classes that are just wrappers around arrays. This is the reason why leaf nodes are
 * stored directly as {@link Object[]} arrays instead of using a more object-oriented approach with some
 * {@code TreeNodeLeaf} class.
