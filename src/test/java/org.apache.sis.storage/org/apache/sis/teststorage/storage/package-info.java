/**
 * Helper classes for testing {@link org.apache.sis.storage.DataStore} implementations.
 * The {@link org.apache.sis.test.storage.CoverageReadConsistency} class reads a coverage fully,
 * then requests various sub-regions. Sub-regions are than compared to the corresponding regions
 * in the full image. It is not a proof that data values are correct, but it shows at least that
 * read operations are consistent for the test data set.
 *
 * <p>The classes in this package can be used by other modules (netCDF, GeoTIFF, <i>etc.</i>).
 * Each module will need to provide a test data file in the format to be tested.
 * That test data shall be small enough for fitting in memory.</p>
