/**
 * A predefined set of data important to Apache SIS but not redistributed for space or licensing reasons.
 * This class is in charge of downloading the data if necessary and asking user's agreement before to install them.
 * Authorities managed by the current implementation are:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code "EPSG"} for the EPSG geodetic dataset.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Data are downloaded from URLs hard-coded in this class. Those URLs depend on the Apache SIS versions in use,
 * typically because more recent SIS versions will reference more recent data.
 * The default URLs can be overridden using system properties documented in {@link #getDownloadURL(String)}.
 * This is useful as a workaround if a URL is no longer accessible.
