/**
 * A tile identified by a location, a dimension and a subsampling.
 * This class can be used for constructing a mosaic or a pyramid of images.
 * While the Javadoc discusses image I/O operations, this {@code Tile} class is not restricted to imagery.
 * This class is also used for managing tiles in a datum shift file encoded in NTv2 format.
 *
 * <p>Each tile contains the following:</p>
 * <ul class="verbose">
 *   <li><b>A format name or a provider of {@link ImageReader}</b> (optional).
 *   The same format is typically used for every tiles, but this is not mandatory.
 *   An {@linkplain ImageReader image reader} can be instantiated before a tile is read.</li>
 *
 *   <li><b>An image input</b> (optional), typically a {@link java.nio.file.Path} or {@link java.net.URL}.
 *   The input is often different for every tile to be read, but this is not mandatory. For example tiles
 *   could be stored at different {@linkplain #getImageIndex() image index} in the same file.</li>
 *
 *   <li><b>An image index</b> to be given to {@link ImageReader#read(int)} for reading the tile.
 *   This index is often 0.</li>
 *
 *   <li><b>The upper-left corner</b> in the destination image as a {@link Point},
 *   or the upper-left corner together with the image size as a {@link Rectangle}.
 *   If the upper-left corner has been given as a point, then the
 *   {@linkplain ImageReader#getWidth(int) width} and {@linkplain ImageReader#getHeight(int) height}
 *   may be obtained from the image reader when first needed, which may have a slight performance cost.
 *   If the upper-left corner has been given as a rectangle instead, then this performance cost is avoided
 *   but the user is responsible for the accuracy of the information provided.
 *
 *     <div class="note"><b>NOTE:</b>
 *     the upper-left corner is the {@linkplain #getLocation() location} of this tile in the
 *     {@linkplain javax.imageio.ImageReadParam#setDestination destination image} when no
 *     {@linkplain javax.imageio.ImageReadParam#setDestinationOffset destination offset} are specified.
 *     If the user specified a destination offset, then the tile location will be translated accordingly
 *     for the image being read.
 *     </div></li>
 *
 *   <li><b>The subsampling relative to the tile having the best resolution.</b>
 *   This is not the subsampling to apply when reading this tile, but rather the subsampling that we would
 *   need to apply on the tile having the finest resolution in order to produce an image equivalent to this tile.
 *   The subsampling is (1,1) for the tile having the finest resolution, (2,3) for an overview having
 *   half the width and third of the height for the same geographic extent, <i>etc.</i>
 *   (note that overviews are not required to have the same geographic extent - the above is just an example).
 *
 *     <div class="note"><b>NOTE 1:</b>
 *     the semantic assumes that overviews are produced by subsampling, not by interpolation or pixel averaging.
 *     The latter are not prohibited, but doing so introduce some subsampling-dependent variations in images read,
 *     which would not be what we would expect from a strictly compliant {@link ImageReader}.</div>
 *
 *     <div class="note"><b>NOTE 2:</b>
 *     tile {@linkplain #getLocation() location} and {@linkplain #getRegion() region} coordinates should be
 *     specified in the overview pixel units - they should <em>not</em> be pre-multiplied by subsampling.
 *     This multiplication should be performed automatically by a {@code TileManager} when comparing regions
 *     from tiles at different subsampling levels.
 *     </div></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The tiles are not required to be arranged on a regular grid, but performances may be better if they are.
 * {@link TileOrganizer} is responsible for analyzing the layout of a collection of tiles.
 *
 * <h2>Multi-threading</h2>
 * This class is thread-safe. In addition {@code Tile} instances can be considered as immutable after construction.
 * However some properties may be available only after the tiles have been processed by a {@link TileOrganizer},
 * or only after {@link #fetchSize()} has been invoked.
