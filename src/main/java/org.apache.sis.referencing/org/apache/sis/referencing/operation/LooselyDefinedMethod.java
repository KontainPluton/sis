/**
 * Operation methods that do not match exactly any of the predefined "standard" methods and for which
 * we do not define unambiguous sets of parameters. Those methods could be replaced by concatenations
 * of standard methods, but doing so would require more development work.  In the meantime, we define
 * those methods for avoiding to mislead users. For example we should not call a coordinate operation
 * "Affine" if it also performs conversion from geographic to geocentric coordinates.
 *
 * <h2>Restrictions</h2>
 * We do not provide any mechanism for instantiating a {@code CoordinateOperation} from those methods.
 * Consequently a coordinate operation can be formatted in WKT with those operation methods, but can
 * not be parsed. Attempt to parse such WKT will result in an error saying that the method is unknown.
 * This is better than formatting WKT with a standard but wrong operation name, in which case parsing
 * the WKT would produce unexpected results.
 *
 * <h2>Future evolution</h2>
 * A cleaner approach would be to replace those methods by a concatenation of standard methods.
 * {@link org.apache.sis.referencing.operation.transform.DefaultMathTransformFactory#getLastMethodUsed()}
 * can be invoked after {@code factory.createCoordinateSystemChange(â€¦)} for getting pieces of information
 * needed, but we still have to put all the pieces together.
