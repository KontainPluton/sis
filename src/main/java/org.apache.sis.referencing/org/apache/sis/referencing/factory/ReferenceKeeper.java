/**
 * Most recently used objects stored or accessed in {@link ConcurrentAuthorityFactory#findPool},
 * retained by strong references for preventing too early garbage collection.
 *
 * <h2>Design notes</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Elements in this collection are generally not in {@link ConcurrentAuthorityFactory#cache}
 *       because they are "foreigner" objects, possibly created by different authorities.
 *       We have to maintain them in a separated collection.</li>
 *   <li>We have to be careful about the references kept in this object. The purpose is to prevent garbage collection,
 *       so {@link Object#equals(Object)} is not the appropriate contract for deciding which elements to put.
 *       For example a call to {@code Map.put(key, value)} may update the value without replacing the key if an
 *       entry already exists in the map, in which case the instance that is protected against garbage collection
 *       is not the intended one.</li>
 *   <li>We tried to use {@link java.util.LinkedHashMap} as a LRU map in a previous version.
 *       It was not really simpler because of above-cited issue with object identities.</li>
 * </ul>
