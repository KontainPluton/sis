/**
 * A stream which delay the creation of the source stream as long as possible.
 * This stream gives to subclasses an opportunity to collect more information before to create the source.
 * The source stream is implemented by a {@link Spliterator} created by {@link #createSourceIterator()}.
 * The call to that method is deferred until a terminal operation is invoked.
 *
 * <div class="note"><b>Example:</b>
 * if a stream can count its elements efficiently (e.g. using a {@code COUNT} query on SQL databases),
 * a {@code DeferredStream} subclass can override the {@link #count()} method for running the count query
 * instead of counting elements of the stream manually.
 *
 * <p>Deferred streams are also useful with intermediate operations. For example a subclass can override
 * the {@link #skip(long)} and {@link #limit(long)} methods for modifying the SQL query with addition of
 * {@code OFFSET} and {@code FETCH NEXT} clauses before the worker stream is created.</p></div>
