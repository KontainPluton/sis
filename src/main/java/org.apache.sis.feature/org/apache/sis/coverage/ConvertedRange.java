/**
 * Range of real values computed from the range of the sample values.
 * The {@link Category#toConverse} conversion is used by the caller for computing the inclusive and exclusive
 * minimum and maximum values of this range. We compute both the inclusive and exclusive values because we can not
 * rely on the default implementation, which looks for the nearest representable number. For example if the range
 * of sample values is 0 to 10 exclusive (or 0 to 9 inclusive) and the scale is 2, then the range of real values
 * is 0 to 20 exclusive or 0 to 18 inclusive, not 0 to 19.9999â€¦ The numbers between 18 and 20 is a "gray area"
 * where we don't know for sure what the user intents to do.
