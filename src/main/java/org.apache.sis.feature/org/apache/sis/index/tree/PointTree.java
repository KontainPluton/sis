/**
 * A <var>k</var>-dimensional tree index for points.
 * For <var>k</var>=2, this is a <cite>point QuadTree</cite>.
 * For <var>k</var>=3, this is a point <cite>Octree</cite>.
 * Higher dimensions are also accepted up to {@value #MAXIMUM_DIMENSIONS} dimensions.
 * Elements are stored in this {@code PointTree} as arbitrary non-null objects with their coordinates
 * computed by a user-specified {@code locator} function. That function expects an element {@code E}
 * in argument and returns its coordinates as a {@code double[]} array.
 * The coordinates of each elements must be <em>stable</em>, i.e. applying the {@code locator} function
 * twice on the same element must return the same coordinates.
 * Searches based on element coordinates can be done with the following methods:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #queryByBoundingBox(Envelope)}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The performances of this {@code PointTree} depends on two parameters: an estimated bounding box of the points
 * to be added in this tree and a maximal capacity of leaf nodes (not to be confused with a capacity of the tree).
 * More details are given in the {@linkplain #PointTree(Class, Envelope, Locator, int, boolean) constructor}.
 *
 * <h2>Thread-safety</h2>
 * This class is not thread-safe when the tree content is modified. But if the tree is kept unmodified
 * after construction, then multiple read operations in concurrent threads are safe. Users can synchronize
 * with {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock} (the read lock must be held for complete duration
 * of iterations or stream consumptions).
 *
 * <h2>Serialization</h2>
 * This tree is serializable if the {@code locator} function and all elements in the tree are also serializable.
 * However the serialization details is implementation specific and may change in any future Apache SIS version.
 *
 * <h2>Limitations</h2>
 * Current implementation does not yet support removal of elements.
 *
 * <h2>References</h2>
 * Insertion algorithm is based on design of QuadTree index in H. Samet,
 * <u>The Design and Analysis of Spatial Data Structures</u>.
 * Massachusetts: Addison Wesley Publishing Company, 1989.
