/**
 * Helper objects needed during the execution of a filtering operation.
 * Those objects are assumed non-thread safe; different instances will be created for each thread.

 * <p>Ideally this object should be created when a filtering operation on a collection of features
 * is about to start, and disposed after the filtering operation is completed. We do not yet have
 * a notification mechanism for those events, so current implementation use a {@link ThreadLocal}.
 * A future version may revisit this strategy and expand the use of "filtering context" to all
 * geometry implementations, not only JTS (but we may keep a specialized JTS subclass).</p>
