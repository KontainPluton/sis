/**
 * Calculation in a two-dimensional space that can be subdivided in smaller calculations in sub-regions.
 * This class manages a kind of fork-join task but differs from {@link java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool}
 * in the following aspects:
 *
 * <ul class="verbose">
 *   <li>The fork and join processes are presumed relatively costly (i.e. they may need to reconstruct
 *       geometries splitted in two consecutive tiles). So instead of having many medium tasks waiting
 *       for a thread to take them, it may be more efficient to have fewer tasks processing larger areas.
 *       {@code TiledProcess} tries to create a number of sub-tasks close to the number of processors.
 *       This is a different approach than "work stealing" algorithm applied by JDK {@code ForkJoinPool},
 *       which is designed for smaller (and more easily separable) non-blocking tasks.</li>
 *   <li>The main task is splitted in sub-tasks with a single fork step, with two division factors along
 *       <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> axes which can be any integer (not necessarily powers of 2). This
 *       is a different approach than JDK {@code ForkJoinPool} where tasks are forked recursively in two
 *       sub-tasks at each step.</li>
 *   <li>The join operation tries to operate on tiles that are neighbors in the two dimensional space.
 *       It allows the join operation to merge geometries that are splited between two tiles.</li>
 *   <li>Tasks may block on I/O operations. We want to avoid blocking the JDK common fork/join pool,
 *       so we use a separated pool.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The tiling applied by {@code TiledProcess} is independent of {@link RenderedImage} tiling.
 * This class assumes that the objects to be calculated are geometries or other non-raster data.
 * Consequently tile size will be determined by other considerations such as the number of processors.
