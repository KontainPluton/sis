/**
 * A computed image for which it is more efficient to compute tiles in batch instead of one-by-one.
 * This class is useful only when users may prefetch in advance groups of tiles by calls to the
 * {@link org.apache.sis.image.ImageProcessor#prefetch(RenderedImage, Rectangle)} method.
 *
 * <h2>Caching</h2>
 * Implementations should manage their own cache for avoiding to compute the same tiles many times.
 * The caching mechanism inherited from {@link ComputedImage} is less useful here.
