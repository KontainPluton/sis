/**
 * An image with tiles computed on-the-fly and cached for future reuse.
 * Computations are performed on a tile-by-tile basis (potentially in different threads)
 * and the results are stored in a cache shared by all images in the runtime environment.
 * Tiles may be discarded at any time or may become dirty if a source has been modified,
 * in which case those tiles will be recomputed when needed again.
 *
 * <p>{@code ComputedImage} may have an arbitrary number of source images, including zero.
 * A {@link TileObserver} is automatically registered to all sources that are instances of
 * {@link WritableRenderedImage}. If one of those sources sends a change event, then all
 * {@code ComputedImage} tiles that may be impacted by that change are marked as <cite>dirty</cite>
 * and will be computed again when needed.</p>
 *
 * <p>When this {@code ComputedImage} is garbage collected, all cached tiles are discarded
 * and the above-cited {@link TileObserver} is automatically removed from all sources.
 * This cleanup can be requested without waiting for garbage collection by invoking the
 * {@link #dispose()} method, but that call should be done only if the caller is certain
 * that this {@code ComputedImage} will not be used anymore.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Pixel coordinate system</h2>
 * Default implementation assumes that the pixel in upper-left left corner is located at coordinates (0,0).
 * This assumption is consistent with {@link org.apache.sis.coverage.grid.GridCoverage#render(GridExtent)}
 * contract, which produces an image located at (0,0) when the image region matches the {@code GridExtent}.
 * However subclasses can use a non-zero origin by overriding the methods documented in the
 * <cite>Sub-classing</cite> section below.
 *
 * <p>If this {@code ComputedImage} does not have any {@link WritableRenderedImage} source, then there is
 * no other assumption on the pixel coordinate system. But if there is writable sources, then the default
 * implementation assumes that source images occupy the same region as this {@code ComputedImage}:
 * all pixels at coordinates (<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>) in this {@code ComputedImage} depend on pixels
 * at the same (<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>) coordinates in the source images,
 * possibly shifted or expanded to neighborhood pixels as described in {@link #SOURCE_PADDING_KEY}.
 * If this assumption does not hold, then subclasses should override the
 * {@link #sourceTileChanged(RenderedImage, int, int)} method.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Sub-classing</h2>
 * <p>Subclasses need to implement at least the following methods:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #getWidth()}  — the image width in pixels.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #getHeight()} — the image height in pixels.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #computeTile(int, int, WritableRaster)} — invoked when a
 *       requested tile is not in the cache or needs to be updated.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>If pixel coordinates or tile indices do not start at zero,
 * then subclasses shall also override the following methods:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #getMinX()}     — the minimum <var>x</var> coordinate (inclusive) of the image.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #getMinY()}     — the minimum <var>y</var> coordinate (inclusive) of the image.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #getMinTileX()} — the minimum tile index in the <var>x</var> direction.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #getMinTileY()} — the minimum tile index in the <var>y</var> direction.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Writable computed images</h2>
 * {@code ComputedImage} can itself be a {@link WritableRenderedImage} if subclasses decide so.
 * A writable computed image is an image which can retro-propagate sample value changes to the source images.
 * This class provides {@link #hasTileWriters()}, {@link #getWritableTileIndices()}, {@link #isTileWritable(int, int)}
 * and {@link #markTileWritable(int, int, boolean)} methods for {@link WritableRenderedImage} implementations convenience.
 *
 * <p>Apache SIS <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SIS-487">does not yet define a synchronization policy</a>
 * between {@link #getTile(int, int) getTile(…)} method and {@link WritableRenderedImage#getWritableTile(int, int)
 * WritableRenderedImage​.getWritableTile}/{@link WritableRenderedImage#releaseWritableTile releaseWritableTile(…)} methods.
 * For example if a call to {@code getTile(tileX, tileY)} is followed by a call to {@code getWritableTile(tileX, tileY)}
 * in another thread, there is no guarantee about whether or not the sample values seen in the {@link Raster} would be
 * isolated from the write operations done concurrently in the {@link WritableRaster}.
 * A future SIS version may define a policy (possibly based on {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock}).</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that despite above-cited issue, all methods in this {@code ComputedImage} class are thread-safe.
 * What is not thread-safe is writing into a {@link WritableRaster} from outside the {@link #computeTile
 * computeTile(…)} method, or reading a {@link Raster} after it {@linkplain #markDirtyTiles became dirty}
 * if the change to dirty state happened after the call to {@link #getTile(int, int) getTile(…)}.</p>
