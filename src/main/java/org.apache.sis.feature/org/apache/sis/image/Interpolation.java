/**
 * Algorithm for image interpolation (resampling). Interpolations are performed by sampling on a regular grid

 *
 * <p>All methods in this class shall be safe for concurrent use in multi-threading context.
 * For example interpolations may be executed in a different thread for each tile in an image.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class is designed for interpolations in a two-dimensional space only.</p>
