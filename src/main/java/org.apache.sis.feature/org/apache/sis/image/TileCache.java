 *
 * <h2>Design note</h2>
 * The use of a common cache for all images makes easier to set an application-wide limit
 * (for example 25% of available memory). The use of soft reference does not cause as much
 * memory retention as it may seem because those references are hold only as long as the
 * image exist. When an image is garbage collected, the corresponding soft references are
 * {@linkplain Key#dispose() cleaned}.
