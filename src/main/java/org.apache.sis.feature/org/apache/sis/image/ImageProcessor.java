/**
 * A predefined set of operations on images as convenience methods.
 * After instantiation, {@code ImageProcessor} can be configured for the following aspects:
 *
 * <ul class="verbose">
 *   <li>
 *     {@linkplain #setInterpolation(Interpolation) Interpolation method} to use during resampling operations.
 *   </li><li>
 *     {@linkplain #setFillValues(Number...) Fill values} to use for pixels that can not be computed.
 *   </li><li>
 *     {@linkplain #setCategoryColors(Function) Category colors} for mapping sample values
 *     (identified by their range, name or unit of measurement) to colors.
 *   </li><li>
 *     {@linkplain #setImageResizingPolicy(Resizing) Image resizing policy} to apply
 *     if a requested image size prevent the image to be tiled.
 *   </li><li>
 *     {@linkplain #setPositionalAccuracyHints(Quantity...) Positional accuracy hints}
 *     for enabling the use of faster algorithm when a lower accuracy is acceptable.
 *   </li><li>
 *     Whether operations can be executed in parallel. By default operations on unknown
 *     {@link RenderedImage} implementations are executed sequentially in the caller thread, for safety reasons.
 *     Some operations can be parallelized, but it should be enabled only if the {@link RenderedImage} is known
 *     to be thread-safe and has concurrent (or fast) implementation of {@link RenderedImage#getTile(int, int)}.
 *     Apache SIS implementations of {@link RenderedImage} can be parallelized, but it may not be the case of
 *     images from other libraries.
 *   </li><li>
 *     Whether the operations should fail if an exception is thrown while processing a tile.
 *     By default errors during calculation are propagated as an {@link ImagingOpException},
 *     in which case no result is available. But errors can also be notified as a {@link LogRecord} instead,
 *     in which case partial results may be available.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * For each image operations, above properties are combined with parameters given to the operation method.
 * Each method in this {@code ImageProcessor} class documents the properties used in addition of method parameters.
 *
 * <div class="note"><b>API design:</b>
 * properties (setter methods) are used for values that can be applied unchanged on many different images.
 * For example the {@linkplain #getInterpolation() interpolation method} can be specified once and used
 * unchanged for many {@link #resample resample(…)} operations.
 * On the other hand, method arguments are used for values that are usually specific to the image to process.
 * For example the {@link MathTransform} argument given to the {@link #resample resample(…)} operation depends
 * tightly on the source image and destination bounds (also given in arguments); those information usually need
 * to be recomputed for each image.</div>
 *
 * <h2>Deferred calculations</h2>
 * Methods in this class may compute the result at some later time after the method returned, instead of computing
 * the result immediately on method call. Consequently unless otherwise specified, {@link RenderedImage} arguments
 * should be <em>stable</em>, i.e. pixel values should not be modified after method return.
 *
 * <h2>Area of interest</h2>
 * Some operations accept an optional <cite>area of interest</cite> argument specified as a {@link Shape} instance in
 * pixel coordinates. If a shape is given, it should not be modified after {@code ImageProcessor} method call because
 * the given object may be retained directly (i.e. the {@code Shape} is not always cloned; it depends on its class).
 * In addition, the {@code Shape} implementation shall be thread-safe (assuming its state stay unmodified)
 * unless the execution mode is set to {@link Mode#PARALLEL}.
 *
 * <h2>Error handling</h2>
 * If an exception occurs during the computation of a tile, then the {@code ImageProcessor} behavior
 * is controlled by the {@link #getErrorHandler() errorHandler} property:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>If {@link ErrorHandler#THROW}, the exception is wrapped in an {@link ImagingOpException} and thrown.</li>
 *   <li>If {@link ErrorHandler#LOG}, the exception is logged and a partial result is returned.</li>
 *   <li>If any other value, the exception is wrapped in a {@link LogRecord} and sent to that filter.
 *     The filter can store the log record, for example for showing later in a graphical user interface (GUI).
 *     If the filter returns {@code true}, the log record is also logged, otherwise it is silently discarded.
 *     In both cases a partial result is returned.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Thread-safety</h2>
 * {@code ImageProcessor} is safe for concurrent use in multi-threading environment.
 * Note however that {@code ImageProcessor} instances are mutable;
 * consider {@linkplain #clone() cloning} if setter methods are invoked on a shared instance.
