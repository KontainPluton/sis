 * Base class of grid coverage read from a resource where data are stored in tiles.
 * This grid coverage may represent only a subset of the coverage resource.
 * Tiles are read from the storage only when first needed.
 *
 * <h2>Cell Coordinates</h2>
 * When there is no subsampling, this coverage uses the same cell coordinates than the originating resource.
 * When there is a subsampling, cell coordinates in this coverage are divided by the subsampling factors.
 * Conversions are done by {@link #toFullResolution(long, int)}.
 *
 * <h2>Tile coordinate matrix</h2>
 * In each {@code TiledGridCoverage}, indices of tiles starts at (0, 0, …).
 * This class does not use the same tile indices than the coverage resource
 * in order to avoid integer overflow.
