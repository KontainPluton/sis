/**
 * Time when the "physical" loading of raster data should happen. Some resource implementations may
 * not load data immediately when the {@linkplain GridCoverageResource#read read method} is invoked,
 * but instead defer the actual loading until the {@linkplain GridCoverage#render image is rendered}.
 * This enumeration gives some control over the time when data loading happens.
 * The different strategies are compromises between memory consumption,
 * redundant loading of same data and early error detection.
 *
 * <p>Enumeration values are ordered from the most eager strategy to the laziest strategy.
 * The eager strategy is fastest when all pixels are used, at the cost of largest memory consumption.
 * The lazy strategy is more efficient when only a few tiles will be used and those tiles are not known in advance.
 * The lazy strategy is also the only applicable one if the image is too large for holding in memory.</p>
