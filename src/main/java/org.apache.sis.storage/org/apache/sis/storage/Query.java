/**
 * Definition of filtering to apply for fetching a resource subset.
 * Filtering can be applied on {@link FeatureSet} or on {@link GridCoverageResource}.
 * A query contains at least two parts:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Selection</b> for choosing the feature instances to fetch.
 *     This is equivalent to choosing rows in a database table.</li>
 *   <li><b>Projection</b> (not to be confused with map projection) for choosing the
 *     {@linkplain org.apache.sis.feature.DefaultFeatureType#getProperty feature properties} or the
 *     {@linkplain org.apache.sis.coverage.SampleDimension coverage sample dimensions} to fetch.
 *     This is equivalent to choosing columns in a database table.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Compared to the SQL language, {@code Query} contains the information in the {@code SELECT} and
 * {@code WHERE} clauses of a SQL statement. A {@code Query} typically contains filtering capabilities
 * and (sometime) simple attribute transformations. Well known query languages include SQL and CQL.
 *
 * <h2>Optional values</h2>
 * All aspects of this query are optional and initialized to "none".
 * Unless otherwise specified, all methods accept a null argument or can return a null value, which means "none".
