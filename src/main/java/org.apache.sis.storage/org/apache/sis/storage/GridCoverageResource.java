 * <ul class="verbose">
 *   <li>The function input is a position valid in the coverage <cite>domain</cite>. In the particular case of
 *       {@link GridCoverage}, the domain is described by a {@linkplain #getGridGeometry() grid geometry}.</li>
 *   <li>The function output is a record of values in the coverage <cite>range</cite>. In the particular case of
 *       {@link GridCoverage}, the range is described by a list of {@linkplain #getSampleDimensions() sample dimensions}.</li>
