     *       this is the top-left corner of the top-left pixel.</li>

     * <h4>Relationship with OGC specification</h4>
     * OGC has a more generic definition of <cite>tiling scheme</cite>,
     * where the scheme specifies which space a uniquely identified tile occupies.
     * Reversely, the tiling scheme makes possible to find which unique identifier
     * corresponds to a space satisfying the geometric properties to be a tile.
     * In {@code TileMatrix}, the unique identifier of a tile is the sequence of
     * tile indices stored in a {@code long[]} array.
     * The space occupied by a tile can be computed by the above-cited "grid to CRS" transform.
     * Reversely the tile indices for a given space can be computed by the inverse of the "grid to CRS" transform.
