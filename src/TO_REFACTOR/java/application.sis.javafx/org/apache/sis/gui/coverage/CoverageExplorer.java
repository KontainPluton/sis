/**
 * An image or tabular view of {@link GridCoverage} together with controls for band selection and other operations.
 * The class contains two properties:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A {@link GridCoverage} supplied by user.
 *       May be specified indirectly with an {@link ImageRequest} for loading the coverage.</li>
 *   <li>A {@link View} type which specify how to show the coverage:
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>using {@link GridView} for showing numerical values in a table, or</li>
 *       <li>using {@link CoverageCanvas} for showing the coverage as an image.</li>
 *     </ul>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Controls are provided for allowing user to customize map projection, number formats, <i>etc.</i>.
 * The set of control depends on the view type.
 *
 * <h2>Limitations</h2>
 * Current implementation is restricted to {@link GridCoverage} instances, but a future
